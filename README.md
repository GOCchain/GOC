GOC Chain Blockchain Advantage

Open, consensus
Each device can act as a node, and each node is allowed to obtain a complete copy of the database. The nodes maintain a common blockchain through competitive computing based on a set of consensus mechanisms. If any node fails, the remaining nodes will still work normally.

Not tamperable, traceable
Modifications to the database by a single or even multiple nodes cannot affect the database of other nodes unless it is possible to control more than 51% of the nodes in the entire network to modify at the same time. So it can be traced back to the past and present of any transaction.

Transaction is transparent, both parties are anonymous
The rules of the blockchain are open and transparent, and all data information is public, so each transaction is visible to all nodes. Since each node participating in the trust between the node and the node is anonymous.

Go to the center, go to trust
A blockchain consists of a number of nodes that together form an end-to-end network. There are no centralized devices and management organizations. Data exchange between nodes is verified by digital signature technology without mutual trust.

GOC Chain Blockchain Advantage
1. A limited amount of constant issuance, never issued;
2. P2P and C2C point-to-point transactions,
3. The joint venture of the entity enterprise;
4, dual system parallel;
5. The new application of blockchain is more perfect for circulation;
